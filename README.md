# Book Keeper
This an application to keep track of books that I have read and will read. 

## How it Works: 
I use an SQL Database to store the books. Then the SQL Database can be queried for the data that it stores. I can add, delete and modify data with these queries. Since I'm on Debian I use MariaDB (MySQL for Debian). 

# Why? The Inspiration: 
I wanted to learn Java and SQL. Also to finally have an application that saves data.  

# TODO: 
- Create a Window
- Determine what files are necessary
- Establish a connection to the DB
- Use SQL to organize and group data
- Use a Makefile for the project to build
- Use Docker to "ship" the application

# How it Looks: 
Not like much.
